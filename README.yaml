# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This is a terraform module that creates a lambda function that rotates Cloudflare secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

introduction: |-

  The provided lambda can rotate these types of cloudflare secrets:

  1. api tokens - Rotate API tokens with granular permissions (tokens are visible at https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
  2. tunnel service keys - Rotate tunnel service keys using a non-public API. NOTE: currently there is no way to expire or revoke a service key.
  3. argo tunnel tokens - Creates and rotates the certfiles you need to pass cloudflared for setting up an Argo tunnel. More information on the structure of this file
     [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/faq#what-causes-tunnels-to-fail-to-authenticate)

  One lambda can manage multiple AWS Secrets Manager (SM) Secrets.

  Each AWS SM Secret can only wrap one of the above secret types.

  Each type of secret needs a different credential for the lambda to
  authenticate it self to Cloudflare.

  1. api tokens - requires an api token with the User.API Tokens permission
  2. tunnel serivce keys - requires the full Global API Key and account email address
  3. argo tunnel tokens - requires a tunnel service key and the Origin CA Key
                          the tunnel service key is accepted as an environment variable or optionally as an ARN to another AWS SM Secret that contains the tunnel service key

  This module does not provision the aws secrets manager secrets resource.

# How to use this project
usage: |-

  ```hcl
  module "cf_rotate" {
    source          = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-lambda-secrets-manager-cloudflare.git?ref=master"

    # only necessary to pass the credentials needed for the secrets that this lambda will rotate
    api_token       = "xxx" # with User.API Tokens permission
    api_key         = "xxx"
    api_email       = "user@example.com"
    api_origin_key  = "xxx"
    api_tunnel_service_key = "xxx" # or ..
    api_tunnel_service_key_arns = ["xxxxxx"] # .. the arn takes priority

    secret_prefix = "cloudflare/*"

    namespace       = var.namespace
    name            = var.name
    stage           = var.stage
    delimiter       = var.delimiter
    attributes      = ["cf", "rotate"]
    tags            = var.tags
  }
